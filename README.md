# Stock-Portfolio-Tracker

# Stock Portfolio Tracker (Python + GUI)

A Python-based **Stock Portfolio Tracker** that allows users to **add**, **remove**, **modify**, and **track** the performance of their stock investments. The application uses
**real-time stock data** from the `yfinance` API and provides an easy-to-use **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Tkinter.


## Features:

-  Add new stocks to your portfolio (with ticker symbol, quantity, and price)
-  Modify existing stock entries
-  Remove unwanted stocks from your portfolio
-  View current market price and portfolio value using `yfinance`
-  See the total number of shares and overall investment performance
-  User-friendly interface built with Tkinter
-  Tracks at least 10 different stocks (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Airtel, Jio, Reliance, etc.)



##  Technologies Used:

- **Python 3.13
- **Tkinter** – for the GUI
- **yfinance** – for fetching real-time stock data
- **datetime** – for timestamp and optional future enhancement


##  Why GUI?

Although the original project specification did not require a GUI, a graphical interface was added to:
- Enhance usability
- Make the tool easier to interact with for non-technical users
- Demonstrate GUI programming skills as part of the internship learning outcomes

This still meets all the functional requirements of the project.


## How to Run the Project:

### Step 1: Install Python

- Download python IDLE

### Step 2: Install Required Library

pip install yfinance

### step 3: Run the program
